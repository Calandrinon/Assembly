# Tools for Computer System Architecture lab
Some tools for the computer system architecture lab and a bash script written by me to automate the assembling process for Linux with wine.

Run the script "script" from the folder /npp/. Usage:

./script [project_name]

Example: let's say we have a file hello_world.asm
To assemble it with the script, type the following line:

./script hello_world


Don't forget to run everything from /npp/
